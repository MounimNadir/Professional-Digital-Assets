# Professional Digital Assets & Insights 🚀
**By Mounim Nadir | SITBD Graduate Student @ FST Tanger**

Welcome to my central repository for technical content. This space serves as a "Proof of Work" for my journey in **Cybersecurity**, **Big Data**, and **IT Infrastructure**. Here, I store the source files, research PDFs, and documentation for insights I share on LinkedIn and Facebook.

## 🛡️ Focus Areas
- **Network Security:** Penetration testing, GNS3 simulations, and firewall configurations (pfSense).
- **Big Data & AI:** Machine Learning models (Random Forest, LSTM, GRU) and predictive maintenance.
- **DevOps & Linux:** System administration (RHEL/Kali), Docker/Kubernetes, and CI/CD concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/Networking`: GNS3 topologies, VPN guides, and protocol analysis.
- `/Data-Science`: Predictive maintenance research and ML scripts.
- `/CheatSheets`: Quick reference guides for Linux and Security tools.
- `/Presentations`: PDF versions of my social media slide decks.
